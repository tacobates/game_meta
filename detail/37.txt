This puzzle game has a grueling solo campaign, but is more famous for its 2 player face off mode.<br>Part tetris & Dr. Mario, this game adds a twist by removing your Godlike ability to move falling pieces, and instead puts you at the mercy of others dropping pieces. You scramble around inside the board picking up stacks and lining them up for groovy and sweet combinations that give you advantages or punish your opponent.<br>Play alone for a while, but when the bots start kicking your butt (as they inevitably will), grab a friend and submit them to your newly honed skills.
