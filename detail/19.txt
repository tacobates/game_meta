Truly an innovation of its day.  Off Road allowed 4 players to race in a 3/4 overhead arena.  That's right, 4 players! You had to buy a special adaptor just to connect more controllers!<br>Though outpaced by modern racers, this game is still worth playing through. Not only is it well done, but it's amazing to spot all the ways in which this classic inspired later titles.
